# Animation using JavaScript
## Overview
This is a practice repository where I learn new and nifty tricks on how to use javascript to my advantage and help advance my animation skills.
### My main reason for this practice is for:
- To help design my portfolio website
- To help with my frontend website making skills
- Practice to familiarise myself with more Javascript rather than only relying on CSS
